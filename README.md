pydov is a Python package to query and download data from [Databank Ondergrond Vlaanderen (DOV)](https://www.dov.vlaanderen.be). It is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/DOV-Vlaanderen/pydov) and development is coordinated by Databank Ondergrond Vlaanderen (DOV). DOV aggregates data about soil, subsoil and groundwater of Flanders and makes them publicly available. Interactive and human-readable extraction and querying of the data is provided by a [web application](https://www.dov.vlaanderen.be/portaal/?module=verkenner#ModulePage), whereas the focus of this package is to **support machine-based extraction and conversion of the data**.

To get started, see the documentation at https://pydov.readthedocs.io.

Please note that downloading DOV data with pydov is governed by the same [disclaimer](https://www.dov.vlaanderen.be/page/disclaimer) that applies to the other DOV services. Be sure to consult it when using DOV data with pydov.

## Installation

You can install `pydov` stable using pip:

```shell script
pip install pydov
```

Or clone the [git repository](https://github.com/DOV-Vlaanderen/pydov) and install with `python setup.py install` to get the latest snapshot from the master branch.

To contribute to the code, make sure to install the package and all of the development dependencies enlisted in the
[requirements_dev.txt](requirements_dev.txt) file. First, clone the [git repository](https://github.com/DOV-Vlaanderen/pydov).
We advice to use an Python development environment, for example with [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). Activate the (conda/virtualenv) environment and
install the package in development mode:

```shell script
pip install -e .[devs]
```
